# CW-Storage-Plus: Enhanced/experimental storage engines for CosmWasm

The ideas in here are based on the `cosmwasm-storage` crate. However,
after much usage, we decided a complete rewrite could allow us to add
more powerful and easy touse interfaces. Here are those interfaces.

**Status: experimental**

You currently should not be using this crate outside of the `cosmwasm-plus`
repo. This is a first draft of many types. We will update the status
after they have been used more heavily and the interfaces stabilized.

The ideas/desired functionality in here should be more or final, 
just the form to express them which will keep changing.
