# Multi Test: Test helpers for multi-contract interactions

Let us run unit tests with contracts calling contracts, and calling
in and out of bank.

This only works with contracts and bank currently. We are working
on refactoring to make it more extensible for more handlers,
including custom messages/queries as well as IBC.
